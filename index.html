            <h2>Why practise with us?</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                Derived from the Sanskrit word "yuji", meaning yoke or union, yoga is an ancient
                practice that brings together mind and body.

                Incorporating breathing exercises, meditation and poses designed to encourage
                relaxation and reduce stress, practising yoga comes with many benefits for both
                mental and physical health.

                <h3>Improve flexibility and mobility</h3>
                <br>
                <p>By spending just a few minutes each day in poses like Warrior and Downward
                    Facing Dog, you can expect to see a difference in your mobility pretty soon,
                    regardless of whether you're pretty bendy or stiff as a board.</p>

            <div class="square">
                <h3>Correct posture</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Daily yoga helps improve your posture, making you walk taller and sit up
                    straighter at your desk. In a study of 80 women published in the Journal of
                    Physical Therapy Science, a programme of intense, short-term yoga posture
                    sessions contributed more to improving spine mobility – especially bending –
                    than any other conventional exercise programme.</p>

            <div class="square">
                <h3>Support heart health</h3>
                <br>
                <p>It's one of the lesser-known benefits of yoga, but yoga is heart-healthy.
                    Studies show that making time for the mat can reduce your cholesterol levels
                    and even slow the progression of heart disease when combined with dietary
                    changes and stress management.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="square">
                <h3>Increase energy levels</h3>
                <br>
                <p>From a spiritual perspective, a daily yoga practice is said to awaken the main
                    energy centres (called chakras) in your body. Great poses for extra energy are
                    those that extend the spine, such as the tree pose, allowing energy to circulate
                    throughout the whole body, and poses that open the chest, like the cobra pose,
                    encouraging the intake of more breath.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="square">
                <h3>Reduce stress</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Yoga is a bona-fide stress buster, so there's good reason to squeeze in a
                    lunchtime session. Research has shown that people who practice yoga regularly
                    have low levels of cortisol, one of the key stress hormones. Not only does yoga
                    improve internal bodily markers of stress, but it also improves your subjective
                    wellbeing, which means you actually feel better, too.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="square">
                <h3>Breathe better</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Yogic breathing techniques (called pranayama) focus on slowing down the breath and
                    breathing from the pit of your stomach to the top of your lungs. As well as
                    sending a message to your brain that soothes your sympathetic nervous system –
                    responsible for the 'fight or flight' response we feel when stressed –
                    these exercises have been shown to increase vital capacity, which refers to the
                    total amount of air your lungs can exhale.</p>
