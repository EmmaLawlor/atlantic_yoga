            <h3>Class Types</h3>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Vinyasa</h4>
                <p>Vinyasa means "to place in a special way" and, in this case, yoga postures.
                    Vinyasa yoga is the often considered the most athletic yoga style. Vinyasa was
                    adapted from ashtanga yoga in the 1980s. In vinyasa classes, the movement is
                    coordinated with your breath and movement to flow from one pose to another.</p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Yin Yoga</h4>
                <p>Yin yoga is a slow-paced style of yoga with seated postures that are held for
                    longer periods of time. Yin can also be a meditative yoga practice that helps
                    you find inner peace. Yin is a great class for beginners, as postures can be held
                    for from 45 seconds to 2 minutes. The classes are relaxed, as you're supposed to
                    let gravity do most of the work. </p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Kundalini</h4>
                <p>Kundalini yoga practice is equal parts spiritual and physical. This style is all
                    about releasing the kundalini energy in your body said to be trapped, or coiled,
                    in the lower spine. These classes really work your core and breathing with
                    fast-moving, invigorating postures and breath exercises. These classes are pretty
                    intense and can involve chanting, mantra, and meditation.</p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Restorative</h4>
                <p>Restorative yoga focuses on winding down and relaxing your mind. At
                    its core, this style focuses on body relaxation. Restorative yoga also helps to
                    cleanse and free your mind. You spend more time in fewer postures throughout the
                    class. Many of the poses are modified to be easier and more relaxing. Many props
                    are used and are placed just right such as blankets, bolsters, and eye pillows.
                    All of the props are there to help you sink deeper into relaxation.</p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Ashtanga</h4>
                <p>In Sanskrit, ashtanga is translated as "Eight Limb path." In Mysore, India, people
                    gather to practice this form of yoga together at their own pace—if you see
                    Mysore-led ashtanga, it's expected of you to know the series. Ashtanga yoga involves
                    a very physically demanding sequence of postures, so this style of yoga is definitely
                    not for the beginner. It takes an experienced yogi to really love it. Ashtanga starts
                    with five sun salutation A's and five sun salutation B's and then moves into a series
                    of standing and floor postures.</p>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <div class="yoga-type">
                <h4>Prenatal</h4>
                <p>Prenatal yoga is carefully adapted for "moms to be" and is tailored to women in all
                    trimesters. Many have said that prenatal is one of the best types of exercise for
                    expectant moms because of the pelvic floor work, focus on breathing, and bonding
                    with the growing baby; prenatal yoga also helps mothers prepare for labor and
                    delivery. During this practice, you'll use props in order to modify your poses and
                    ensure stability—in this class, it's way more about stability than flexibility.</p>
