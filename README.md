### Design Choices

#### Typography

#### Colors

A color scheme of blues and green was chosen for the site as it ties in with the aesthetic of the location of the Atlantic Yoga studio; next to the Atlantic ocean in the South West of Ireland. The color palette also reflects the Home page hero image, creating a seamless appearance when landing on the site.
