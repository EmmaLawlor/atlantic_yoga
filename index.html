            <h2>Why practise with us?</h2>
            <p>
                Derived from the Sanskrit word "yuji", meaning yoke or union, yoga is an ancient 
                practice that brings together mind and body.

                Incorporating breathing exercises, meditation and poses designed to encourage 
                relaxation and reduce stress, practising yoga comes with many benefits for both 
                mental and physical health.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Improve flexibility and mobility</h3>
                    <p>By spending just a few minutes each day in poses like Warrior and Downward 
                        Facing Dog, you can expect to see a difference in your mobility pretty soon, 
                        regardless of whether you're pretty bendy or stiff as a board.</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Correct posture</h3>
                    <p>Daily yoga helps improve your posture, making you walk taller and sit up 
                        straighter at your desk. In a study of 80 women published in the Journal of 
                        Physical Therapy Science, a programme of intense, short-term yoga posture 
                        sessions contributed more to improving spine mobility – especially bending – 
                        than any other conventional exercise programme.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Support heart health</h3>
                    <p>It's one of the lesser-known benefits of yoga, but yoga is heart-healthy. 
                        Studies show that making time for the mat can reduce your cholesterol levels 
                        and even slow the progression of heart disease when combined with dietary 
                        changes and stress management.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Increase your energy</h3>
                    <p>From a spiritual perspective, a daily yoga practice is said to awaken the main 
                        energy centres (called chakras) in your body. Great poses for extra energy are 
                        those that extend the spine, such as the tree pose, allowing energy to circulate 
                        throughout the whole body, and poses that open the chest, like the cobra pose, 
                        encouraging the intake of more breath.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Reduce stress</h3>
                    <p>Yoga is a bona-fide stress buster, so there's good reason to squeeze in a 
                        lunchtime session. Research has shown that people who practice yoga regularly 
                        have low levels of cortisol, one of the key stress hormones. Not only does yoga 
                        improve internal bodily markers of stress, but it also improves your subjective 
                        wellbeing, which means you actually feel better, too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Breathe better</h3>
                    <p>Yogic breathing techniques (called pranayama) focus on slowing down the breath and 
                        breathing from the pit of your stomach to the top of your lungs. As well as 
                        sending a message to your brain that soothes your sympathetic nervous system – 
                        responsible for the 'fight or flight' response we feel when stressed – 
                        these exercises have been shown to increase vital capacity, which refers to the 
                        total amount of air your lungs can exhale.</p>
